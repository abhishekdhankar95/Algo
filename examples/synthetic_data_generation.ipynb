        "# **Using LLMs to Generate Synthetic Data for Fine-Tuning GLiNER**\n",
        "\n",
        "In this notebook, we'll explore a simple way to generate synthetic data for fine-tuning GLiNER. I have used a similar approach to generate training data for [**PII extraction**](https://huggingface.co/urchade/gliner_multi_pii-v1). We will be using `Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2`, though I think there are better LLMs available online (like LLaMa-3 ... etc).\n",
        "\n",
        "Additionally, the prompt used in this example is far from optimal, so you should adapt it to your specific use case or domain. This notebook serves only as an example for practitioners, as some people have requested one.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this notebook, we generate **fully synthetic data**, including both text and entity annotations, but if you have quality data from your target domain, *you can alternatively have the LLM annotate your existing data*. 📊📝\n",
        "\n",
        "Feel free to experiment and tailor the approach to better suit your needs! *Happy fine-tuning!* 🌟"
